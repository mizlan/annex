Warning: this is a bit of a rant.

# The Problem

I maintain the TeachLA editor, which, as one of its core capabilities, is a
Python source file editor that supports
[`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) graphics. `turtle`
graphics are in essence animations that play on a canvas, where a sprite (in
the shape of a turtle) (visibly) moves around the screen and strokes a path in
its trail.

Getting the Python code to run isn't too difficult: there are browser
implementations of Python (that transpile Python source code to Javascript)
like Brython and Skulpt. But because `turtle` depends on Tk for rendering, which
is not present in the browser, these implementations each have developed their
own way of rendering `turtle` graphics. But none of them have the features I need
most, which is the ability to resize screen without having to replay the entire
animation. This is useful for:

- resizing the editor and canvas panes by dragging the split divider
- hiding the canvas pane temporarily, then displaying it again, already rendered

# The Solution (In Theory)

Here's a glimmer of hope: repl.it already has this working on their website:

<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="Video Name">
  <source src="/replit-turtle-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Notice the delay on resizing. I suspect the turtle graphics are rendered on a
server and streamed to the browser (like what this person found in this [Stack
Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69727316/how-to-execute-code-in-server-from-browser)

The optimal solution, in my opinion, is to run all the Python source code on a server with
an actual Python runtime instead of one from the browser. Even though this means the turtle
graphics aren't as smooth (since they aren't "native") as
[Brython](https://brython.info/gallery/turtle.html) and
[Skulpt](https://www.pythonsandbox.com/turtle), it is still a more robust long term solution.

I am still in the process of contacting repl.it to find out how it's done!
