}

I do not play hardcore video games, and video games do not have a significant
impact on my life. However, I'd be lying if I said I do not play any at all.
Here is a list of all video games I used to enjoy and remember, as well as
those I still play.

Historically:

* Tanki Online
* BTD Battles & BTD5
* agar.io, vertix.io & other .io games
* Kingdom Rush
* Hearthstone
* Clash Royale
* 8 Ball Pool
* Texas Hold'em (with play currency)

Currently:

* New York Times Crossword
* Knotwords (yet another word game)
* Clash of Clans (very casually)

I've mostly evolved to watching YouTube to pass time, which I see as a
trade-off: I lose the sense of accomplishment of playing video games but learn
more :)
