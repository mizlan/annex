I do not play hardcore video games, and video games do not have a significant
impact on my life. However, I'd be lying if I said I do not play any at all.
Here is a list of all video games I used to enjoy and remember, as well as
those I still play.

In approximate chronological order:

## Elementary School

* Kingdom Rush
* Tanki Online
* agar.io, vertix.io (and other .io games)
* Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) 4
* Kingdom Rush Frontiers

## Middle School

* BTD Battles & BTD5
* Hearthstone

## High School

* Clash Royale
* 8 Ball Pool (Miniclip)
* Texas Hold'em (play currency)
* New York Times Crossword
* Knotwords
* Mech Arena
* bonk.io

## University

* Mech Arena
* bonk.io
* Crosswords (as well as UK Cryptic Crosswords)
